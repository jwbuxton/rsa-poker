# rsa-poker
Have you used some form of 2-factor authentication?  Does it involve the generation of a six-digit integer? Are you sometimes bored with nothing more interesting than this?  Have you tried to develop some sort of game to play with others in the same boat?

If you've answered "yes" to all four of the above, RSA Poker is for you!  

The project is currently a work in progress, but I've used Python to calculate the odds via brute force for some simple odds.  

| Hand | Frequency | Probability | Odds | Math
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Six of a kind | 10 | 0.001% | 100,000:1 | $${10 \choose 1}$$ |
| Five of a kind | 540 | 0.054% | 1,852:1 | $${10 \choose 1}{6 \choose 1}{9 \choose 1}$$ |
| Five of a kind | 540 | 0.054% | 1,852:1 |  |
| Double threes of a kind | 900 | 0.09% | 1,111:1 |  |
| Four-two full house | 540 | 0.054% | 1,852:1 |  |
| Five of a kind | 540 | 0.054% | 1,852:1 |  |
